```nix
{
programs.starship = {
  enable = true;
  enableZshIntegration = true;
  settings = {
    aws.style = "bold #ffb86c";
    cmd_duration.style = "bold #f1fa8c";
    directory.style = "bold #50fa7b";
    hostname.style = "bold #ff5555";
    git_branch.style = "bold #ff79c6";
    git_status.style = "bold #ff5555";
    username = {
      format = "[$user]($style) on ";
      style_user = "bold #bd93f9";
    };
    character = {
      success_symbol = "[λ](bold #f8f8f2)";
      error_symbol = "[λ](bold #ff5555)";
    };
  };
};
